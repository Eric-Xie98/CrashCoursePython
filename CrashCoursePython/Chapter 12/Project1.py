## This will be our first project using Pygame and this module will document the information in the textbook.

## In this chapter, we'll be setting up Pygame, creating a user input ship that can fire bullets, and learn how to manage large
## projects that span multiple files and refactor code to keep efficiency.

# Planning your project

## Before starting, it's imperative to have a vision or idea of what the game will look like
## and how it'll work. Here's the book's description of the game:

"""In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at
the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends."""

## The first phase of development will involve us installing Pygame and creating the ship and its mechanics
